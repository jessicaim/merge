          <p><span class="lead-in">Recently innovative fashion designers are pushing the boundaries of garment construction</span> far beyond the normal needle and thread, employing the latest in 3D printing techniques to produce technologically advanced wearables. Designs often take shape as futuristic ornaments, like the 3D printed led Pixel Hat—a cap that can definitely put you at risk for onlookers to assume that  you’ve just stumbled out of a rave made by duo, Younghui Kim and Yejin Cho. The 3D printed hat embedded with led lights up, changing whenever the wearer tilts their head.</p>
          <p>Or even more practically, London-based designer Ross Barber’s leather sewn shoes with 3D printed soles. He samples the technique by augmenting his F/W leather shoe line with 3D-printed soles. What’s interesting and innovative here is that Barber is taking something defined as classic and familiar—a leather shoe—and turning it into something completely new by adding an experimental and customizable touch. The technique’s more digestible when paired with a “normal” material like leather. Right now the technology is still a novelty.</p>
          <p>While all of these 3D printed tech designs are garnering attention from the tech-savvy, some are turning heads within the fashion elite as well. Dutch designer Iris van Herpen, a designer at the forefront of the 3D printed revolution, blew us away last week when she unveiled her Spring 2013 Haute Couture collection in Paris.</p>
          <p>Her newest line, Voltage, features gowns and other pieces of awe-inspiring detail that recall plasmatic bolts trapped inside a crystal ball. Van Herpen describes her collection as having been inspired by what she calls “the electricity of the body,” which is apparent in the veritable vibrations given off by the indiscernible gaps between feathery boa-like offshoots in one piece. Clearly, 3D printing techniques are advancing beyond the experimental fringe, and are finding a home in some of the fashion world’s most respected showcases.</p></div>

Clearly, 3D printing techniques are advancing beyond the experimental fringe, and are finding a home in some of the fashion world’s most respected showcases.</p>
        <p>But what exactly is 3D printing? How does it work? 3D printing employs an additive process: layers of material are carefully laid down successively until the desired shape is created. This allows you to make virtually any shape or object, its moving parts and all—even a working handgun or a physical fully-functional camera can be 3D printed. Selective laser sintering <span style="letter-spacing:1px;">(SLS)</span> is the main process used for small-scale objects like jewelry, accessories, and clothing—the things we care about. Layer by layer, a polyamide powder made from particles of raw material is turned into the desired object. <span style="letter-spacing:1px;">SLS</span> is the method preferred by proponents of 3D printed fashion: it’s used by everyone from eyewear label mykita to the fashion designer Francis Bitoni and the Dutch couturier Iris van Herpen.</p>
        <p>To design something to be 3D printed is to think differently about what you’re creating and how it’s created. By using mesh modeling you can transform a geometric virtual shape into a printed physical form—and this is just the beginning of what this technology can do. “If you understand 3D printing to mean the deposition and/or fusing of material by layer,” says Gil Akos, one half of design studio modeLab, “it can really open up what you could consider 3D printing to be. And then, shifting out of plastics into things like plant matter or even flesh—3D printing skin—things like that and such.”</p>

        <p>As for the materials, products can be produced in everything from nylon or plaster to ceramic and metal. Soft materials like <span style="letter-spacing:1px;">TPU</span> or elastomer polymer can also produce flexible products. “in most cases we are doing something no one has done, with a new material no one has worked with before,” Bitoni, the designer behind the world’s first 3D printed dress, explains. “we are transforming matter into media.” He’s right—the range of materials is evolving every day.</p>
        <p>Printers are getting closer to producing good fabric-like materials, using interlocking structures to create weaves and stitches. Duanne Scott, Shapeways&rsquo; “Designer Evangelist,” said that once more fashion designers start using 3D printing, it will make a case for 3D manufacturers to develop more breathable, wearable materials. This is, of course, a chicken and an egg situation, as designers aren’t going to want to migrate to more 3D printing until they know it is as good if not better than their current methods.</p>
        <p>Designers and consumers have a sort of distinct historical and strong emotional affinity to non-synthetic materials like leathers, silks and cotton, and they aren’t going anywhere. It wouldn’t really be surprising to see designers incorporating complex printed elements with traditional materials in the upcoming future. The concept of 3D printing is revolutionizing the market for custom-designed products, and we meet creatives who are applying the technology to their various disciplines.</p>
        <p>3D print technology and materials like mylon can give us complete freedom to create any desired shapes, combining precise handcrafting with modern technology. This led to models like our nova or daisuké frames, which have only been made possible because of this process. 3D printing is challenging and changing not only the product itself, but also our way of thinking about those kinds of products.</p>

        <p>The mylon material, first of all just from a functional perspective, is great to use. There is no other eye-wear material out there that compares to mylon—it’s lightweight, it’s adjustable, it’s durable, it’s flexible. At the same time, it also offers a new kind of aesthetic. Since technology is moving so fast, we have to strive to keep up with the latest developments to reach our full potential. “The limits are endless with a 3D printer,” muses Bre Pettis, the co-founder and ceo of MakerBot Industries, just one of the companies championing the 3D printing movement. “It’s feasible that within a few years, 3D printing wearables will be a common occurrence.”</p>

        <p>A wide range of materials and techniques also means a wider palette of products. Moreover, a hands-on approach that links the consumer with the design process is a huge benefit where fashion is concerned. As Jessica Rosenkrantz, co-founder of generative design studio Nervous System, explains, “3D printing provides a compelling kind of alternative to the way products are designed, manufactured, distributed, and sold today. Instead of designing objects that need to have mass appeal, companies can produce their products on demand and custom-tailored to customer preferences.” Creativity is, essentially, back in the rightful hands of the consumer.</p>
        <p>For the first time ever, models wore clothes and accessories made using 3D printing technology on the runways at New York Fashion Week.</p>
        <p>What makes the above runway show so different from all the others during Fashion Week in New York? The answer, many of the accessories, and even some of the entire outfits, were created on 3D printers. The show even helped kick off the first ever 3D Printshow New York, a conference for things 3D printing related.</p>
